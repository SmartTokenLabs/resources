# resources

This reposititory has been created as a quick and stable solution to host files.

## usage

1. Add files to this repository
2. Point to your file with `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/SmartTokenLabs/resources/your-file-name-goes-here`
3. If you make changes use, `https://www.jsdelivr.com/tools/purge` to clear the cache. Clearing by project folder appears to be the quickest way to clear the cache rather than per file.

Note: Please be careful when deleting files when you are not the publisher or don't have knowledge of where they are utilised.
